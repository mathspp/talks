# Mastering comprehensions

This practical workshop presented the audience with several exercises on comprehensions (list, set, dictionary & generator expressions) and idioms around their usage.

The workshop was based on my book [“Comprehending Comprehensions”](https://mathspp.com/comprehending-comprehensions)
