# Why APL is a language worth knowing

This talk was presented at FnConf 2022.


## Abstract

 > “A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.” ― Alan Perlis, in [“Epigrams on Programming”](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/947955.1083808?casa_token=mfQAspdd04kAAAAA:fHoI22aVH6ZK7DiwWJ5qQxqmr2q5QQSsMmYYw9UxG2e3RkhdF15bAi5KbG0O1bMHu44xjuejf9ZkNzI)

Following Alan Perlis's words, this talk will show why APL is a language worth knowing. In other words, I will devote the talk to showcasing characteristics of APL that are likely to, on the one hand, influence the way you use other programming languages, and, on the other hand, understand concepts of computer science.

By listening to this talk, I hope to convince you that learning a language that is radically different from all the other languages you know isn't harmful. Learning a language that is radically different from all other languages you know won't scatter your knowledge or spread your brain too thin. In fact, learning a language that is radically different from all other languages you know will cement your programming  knowledge, helping you build bridges between topics you didn't even know were connected.

To drive my point home, we take a closer look at two characteristics of APL: the fact that Boolean values are represented by the integers 0 and 1, and the fact that APL is an array-oriented language. In studying these two things, we draw connections to the traditional if statement and to list comprehensions, deepening our understanding of those.


## Outline of the talk

(Reference timings.)

 1. Welcome, introduction, and setting the stage (5 min)
 2. What is APL (5 min)
 3. The relationship between Boolean values and the integers 0 and 1 (10 min)
     1. Boolean values in APL (3 min)
     2. Data-driven conditionals (7 min)
 4. Array-oriented programming and list comprehensions (15 min)
     1. Scalar functions in APL (5 min)
     2. List comprehensions as data transformation expressions (10 min)
 5. Conclusion (3 min)
 6. Q&A (5 min)


## Learning outcomes



There are practical and philosophical takeaways:

 - on the practical side, attendees are expected to
    - learn techniques to get rid of some if statements (or conditional expressions) in their code, and
    - understand list comprehensions are expressions that typically put the focus on the data transformations that are taking place;
 - on the philosophical side of things, I hope to convince you that learning a language that is radically different from all the other languages you know isn't harmful, it won't scatter your knowledge, and it won't spread your brain too thin. In fact, learning a language that is radically different from all other languages you know will cement your programming knowledge, helping you build bridges between topics you didn't even know were connected.


## Target audience

Curious individuals who are looking to deepen their understanding of computer science and programming.


## Prerequisites for attendees

Attendees, above all, should be highly curious individuals.

In terms of programming knowledge, no APL knowledge is required.

For a couple of the examples given, attendees will be expected to

 - be aware of what a “list comprehension” is (in the sense of Haskell's or Python's list comprehensions); and
 - be familiar with the (often informal) association of the True and False Boolean values with the integers 1 and 0 (respectively).
