# You DON'T know comprehensions 🤷

In [this poster session](https://ep2023.europython.eu/session/you-dont-know-comprehensions) I taught comprehensions and I explained the one key advantage of using comprehensions that very few seem to be aware of.

This talk was based on [my article about list comprehensions](http://mathspp.com/blog/pydonts/list-comprehensions-101) and [my book “Comprehending Comprehensions”](https://mathspp.com/comprehending-comprehensions) with +200 exercises on list, dict, and set comprehensions, and generator expressions.
