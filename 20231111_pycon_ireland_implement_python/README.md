# How to implement a Python-like programming language

In this workshop we went through the four main components that let you create a programming language like Python:

 - the tokenizer;
 - the parser;
 - the compiler; and
 - the interpreter.

By implementing everything from scratch, we were able to get a better appreciation of how Python actually works under the hood.

This workshop was based off of a [series of blog articles](https://mathspp.com/blog/tag:bpci) I'm publishing on my blog.
