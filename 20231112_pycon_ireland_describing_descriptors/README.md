# Describing Descriptors

In this talk I explain how descriptors work by drawing parallels with `property`, a built-in more people are accostumed to.

By live-coding through some carefully-selected examples, we explore the dunder methods `__get__`, `__set__`, and `__set_name__`, along with some simpler use cases for descriptors.

This talk was based off of [this blog article](https://mathspp.com/blog/pydonts/describing-descriptors).
