# Smoosh all the things âš¡

This was a lightning talk I gave at [EuroPython 2022](https://ep2022.europython.eu/).
A lightning talk is a talk that has a maximum duration of 5 minutes, which means you need to be able to get to the point of your talk quite quickly!

I had a lot of fun preparing this lightning talk, which is a very short version of a talk I would like to give in the future!
