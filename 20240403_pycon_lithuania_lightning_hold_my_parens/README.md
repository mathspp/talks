# Hold my parentheses

In this lightning talk I show an interesting but unusual piece of Python code to solve the problem of determining if a string contains a balanced set of parentheses.

This piece of code draws from my experience with APL and a written version of the lightning talk can be read [on my blog](https://mathspp.com/blog/hold-my-parentheses).
