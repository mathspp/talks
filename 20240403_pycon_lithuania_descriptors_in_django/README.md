# What are descriptors and why does Django need them?

In this talk I use an example from the Django framework to motivate the need for descriptors in the Python language.

Then, I proceed to explain the descriptor protocol, tying it to the original motivating example, through a live-coded demonstration.

This talk was based off of [this blog article](https://mathspp.com/blog/pydonts/describing-descriptors).
