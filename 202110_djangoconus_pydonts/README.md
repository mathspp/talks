# Pydon'ts ‚Äì Write elegant Python code

This talk will be presented at DjangoCon US 2021.

I will upload the slides closer to the talk date, which will be around the 21st-23rd of October.

(Psst, is it past the date already? üòÖ [Reach out to me on Twitter][twitter] and remind me of how silly I am, please!)


## Abstract

In this talk I show what idiomatic Python code looks like and illustrate how the subjective notion of ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù, or ‚Äúelegant‚Äù code, can make your code objectively better, regardless of your Python skill level.

We do that by visiting several vanilla Python features that people sometimes forget to learn, as they rush to importing all the shiny modules and frameworks they really want to use.

In order to achieve this, we go through the learning journey of a hypothetical Pythonista, taking a function written by them and refactoring it incrementally through the use of Pythonic idioms and patterns.

The whole talk will build around a weekly series of articles I have been publishing, where I explore all the vanilla Python features that make Python one of the most interesting programming languages to learn.
