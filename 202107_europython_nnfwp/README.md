# Implementing a Neural Network from Scratch

This workshop was given by me [at EuroPython 2021](https://ep2021.europython.eu/talks/4hDJyV5-implementing-a-neural-network-from-scratch/).

This workshop was based off of a series of articles [available on my blog](https://mathspp.com/blog/tag:nnfwp)
and [the corresponding eBook](https://gum.co/nnfwp).

## Abstract

The fact that you can just install a library and train machine learning models straight away is amazing, to say the least.
However, if your purpose is to learn how the models work, writing `import pytorch` will not do much for you.

In this hands-on workshop we implement a basic neural network framework, dealing with all the nitty-gritty details, and making sure you build something amazing in a surprisingly short amount of code. We also apply our framework to a real classification problem.

Attendees are expected to have working knowledge of neural networks, matrix algebra and differentiation.
The only installation requirements are Python 3 and numpy.
