# 503 days working on FOSS: lessons learned

I've been working full-time on a Python FOSS project for 503 days, so what did I learn?

Am I a better (Python) programmer?
 Better teammate?
 Better person?

In this talk I will share some lessons I learned over the course of these 503 days:

how to get a tech job in this day & age
how to put your ego aside
how to deal with mistakes
how to interact with users & contributors online
how it feels to collaborate to a large codebase
As for the first 3 questions... Ask my colleagues!

You can find a written version of this talk [on my blog](https://mathspp.com/blog/503-days-working-full-time-on-foss-lessons-learned).
