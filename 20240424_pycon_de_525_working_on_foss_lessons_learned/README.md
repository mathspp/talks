# 525[^1] days working on FOSS: lessons learned

I've been working full-time on a Python FOSS project for 525[^1] days, so what did I learn?

Am I a better (Python) programmer?
Am I a better teammate?
Am I a better person?

In this talk I will share some of the lessons I learned over the course of these 525 days:

 - how to get a tech job in this day & age
 - how to put your ego aside when working with others (who know more than you!) and how to deal with mistakes
 - how to interact with users & contributors online
 - how it feels to collaborate to a large codebase

As for the first three reflective questions, you'll have to ask my colleagues!

[^1]: The talk was submitted and scheduled when I was employed by Textualize and I projected how many days I would've been working for Textualize at the time of the conference but I was fired from Textualize before the conference, so I actually only worked 503 days on this project.

You can find a written version of this talk [on my blog](https://mathspp.com/blog/503-days-working-full-time-on-foss-lessons-learned).
