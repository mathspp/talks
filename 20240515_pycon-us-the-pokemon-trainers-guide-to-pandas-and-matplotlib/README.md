# The Pokémon trainer's guide to pandas & matplotlib

This 3h tutorial focuses in teaching the fundamentals of pandas and matplotlib in a light and interactive environment.
To distinguish this tutorial from the others you can find online, we used data from [the Pokémon franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon), which led to a highly engaging session.

The overall consensus of the participants was that the tutorial was well worth their time and one participant even wrote:

 > “[...] I strongly feel that this tutorial is the gold standard for what teaching should be. [...]”, Gabe C.

The contents of this tutorial are a fraction of the content in my book [“The little book of pandas and matplotlib”](https://mathspp.gumroad.com/l/little-book-pandas-matplotlib) and you can also [attend this tutorial online](https://mathspp.gumroad.com/l/webinar-pandas-matplotlib).
