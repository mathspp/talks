# Talks

This is the repository that will hold all the slide decks for all the talks I give.

Each folder represents a talk/workshop at a given conference,
and the folder name starts with the year and month of that talk,
followed by the name of the conference,
and then a slug/abbreviation of my talk/workshop name.

If you have talk feedback to give,
reach out to me [on Twitter][twitter]
or drop me a line over email to rodrigo at mathspp dot com.

If you like(d) my talk(s), you are going to love my newsletter
to where I send very valuable Python knowledge!
[Subscribe right now!](https://mathspp.com/subscribe)

Finally, I'm very active on Twitter [@mathsppblog][twitter]
where I teach Python in bite-sized portions.
