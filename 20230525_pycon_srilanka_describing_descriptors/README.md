# Describing Descriptors

This talk was presented at [PyCon Sri Lanka](https://pycon.lk) 2023.

## Abstract

Descriptors are one of those things that many don't even bother to learn because they look confusing.
Thankfully for you, I figured out how descriptors work 20 minutes ago, so there is no one better prepared to teach you descriptors than someone who _just_ learned how they work.
In this talk I will provide an example that shows how descriptors work and that will also motivate why they are useful and needed.
By the time we are done, you will be able to implement descriptors in your code, use them for practical purposes and, most importantly, you will be able to deliver a talk just like mine!
The talk will be easier to follow if you are familiar with how properties work (via the `@property` decorator).
