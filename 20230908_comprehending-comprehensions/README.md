# Comprehending comprehensions

In this talk I helped the audience discover the immense potential of Python's list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions, set comprehensions, and generator expressions, as I presented them as an idiom that focuses on data transformations.

The talk was based on my book [“Comprehending Comprehensions”](https://mathspp.com/comprehending-comprehensions)
