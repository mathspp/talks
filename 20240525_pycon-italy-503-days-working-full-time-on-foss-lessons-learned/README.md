# 503 days working full-time on FOSS: lessons learned

In this talk I will share the main lessons I learned after working full-time on a FOSS project for 503 days.
These lessons will revolve around four main points:

 1. how to get a tech job in this day & age
 2. how to put your ego aside when working with others (who know more than you!) and how to deal with mistakes
 3. how to interact with users & contributors online
 4. how it feels to collaborate to a large codebase

With contributors and “wanna-be” contributors in mind, this talk will shed some light on how the FOSS world works and what you can expect when you’re trying to contribute to a FOSS project that you like.
